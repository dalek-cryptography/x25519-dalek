A pure-Rust implementation of x25519 elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange,
as specified by Mike Hamburg and Adam Langley in
[RFC7748](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748), using
[curve25519-dalek](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek).

Alice and Bob are two adorable kittens who have lost their mittens, and they
wish to be able to send secret messages to each other to coordinate finding
them, otherwise—if their caretaker cat finds out—they will surely be called
naughty kittens and be given no pie!

But the two kittens are quite clever.  Even though their paws are still too big
and the rest of them is 90% fuzziness, these clever kittens have been studying
up on modern public key cryptography and have learned a nifty trick called
*elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange*.  With the right incantations, the
kittens will be able to secretly organise to find their mittens, and then spend
the rest of the afternoon nomming some yummy pie!

First, Alice uses `x25519_dalek::SecretKey::generate()` and then
`x25519_dalek::PublicKey::generate()` to produce her secret and public keys:

```rust
extern crate x25519_dalek;
extern crate rand;

use x25519_dalek::generate_secret;
use x25519_dalek::generate_public;
use rand::OsRng;

let mut alice_csprng = OsRng::new().unwrap();
let     alice_secret: SecretKey = SecretKey::generate(&mut alice_csprng);
let     alice_public: PublicKey = PublicKey::generate(&alice_secret);
```

Bob does the same:

```rust
let mut bob_csprng = OsRng::new().unwrap();
let bob_secret: SecretKey = SecretKey::generate(&mut bob_csprng);
let bob_public: SecretKey = PublicKey:generate(&bob_secret);
```

Alice meows across the room, telling `alice_public` to Bob, and Bob
loudly meows `bob_public` back to Alice.  Alice now computes her
shared secret with Bob by doing:

```rust
use x25519_dalek::diffie_hellman;

let shared_secret = diffie_hellman(&alice_secret, &bob_public.as_bytes());
```

Similarly, Bob computes the same shared secret by doing:

```rust
let shared_secret = diffie_hellman(&bob_secret, &alice_public.as_bytes());
```

Voilá!  Alice and Bob can now use their shared secret to encrypt their
meows, for example, by using it to generate a key and nonce for an
authenticated-encryption cipher.

# Warnings

[Our elliptic curve library](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek)
(which this code uses) has received *one* formal cryptographic and security
review.  It has not yet received what we would consider *sufficient* peer
review by other qualified cryptographers to be considered in any way, shape,
or form, safe.

This code matches the test vectors, as specified in
[RFC7748](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748), however:

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
